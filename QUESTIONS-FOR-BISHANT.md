# Questions & heads-ups for Bishan

Things I decided myself and kept going on are in DECISIONS.md. This file holds items I want
your eyes on: genuine questions, and judgment calls where you might want to veto. Nothing here
is blocking my work right now.

Format: newest first. I mark each as [FYI], [VETO?], or [NEED] so you can scan.

## 2026-07-11 — UI redesign plan ("Morning Broadsheet")

These four are the ONLY blocking items in the redesign plan (UI-REDESIGN-PLAN.md Part 0). The
plan is written assuming the recommendations, so "all as recommended" is a complete answer.
Everything else is decided and logged (plan Appendix E + DECISIONS.md).

- **[NEED] D1 — Dark Desk.** Keep dark mode, re-skinned to the new palette ("Midnight Desk",
  Desk-only as today)? **Recommended: keep.** Dropping it deletes a working P6 feature; keeping
  it doubles the Desk visual-regression matrix.
- **[NEED] D2 — Mobile navigation.** On phones, move the five rooms into a bottom tab bar
  (Settings → gear in the top bar), keeping the restrained top bar on desktop? **Recommended:
  bottom tab bar.** Plan B (improved top scroll-strip) is specced in §4.2 if you'd rather keep
  everything up top.
- **[NEED] D3 — Wordmark.** Keep the name "myStockMarket" and adopt the Figma's gradient
  logomark tile, or rename to the Figma's "Market Desk"? **Recommended: keep the name, adopt
  the mark.** A rename touches nav, login, manifest, PWA icons, docs.
- **[NEED] D4 — The two rooms.** Keep the warm-Academy/cool-Desk contrast (translated into the
  new system: lavender glass Desk, warm solid-paper Academy), or unify both rooms on the
  Figma's single lavender look? **Recommended: keep two rooms.** The felt room-switch is a
  product idea the Academy and the Dark-Desk-only rule were built around.

- **[FYI]** The aesthetic constitution was amended today per your directive: CLAUDE.md, plan §3
  (via dp-*.html + regeneration), and RR §9.7 (dated amendment callout) now all agree with
  UI-REDESIGN-PLAN.md; both PDFs re-rendered. Honesty rules untouched.
- **[VETO?]** Bug-fix directions chosen inside your either/or grant: Macro Pulse gets TRUE index
  levels from FRED (SP500/NASDAQCOM/DJIA) with the small-caps slot kept as an explicitly-labeled
  IWM ETF proxy (no free Russell 2000 series); the calendar gets a 7-release FRED allowlist
  (CPI, Jobs, PPI, GDP, PCE, Retail, FOMC) + earnings. Details: plan Part 6, Appendix C.

## 2026-07-11 — P4 (setup cards, base rates, track record)

- **[VETO?] Market regime split for base rates.** The plan says base rates are conditioned by
  "regime" but doesn't crisply define the regimes. I assumed a breadth dichotomy: **risk_on** when
  ≥ 50% of the universe is above its 50-day average on the event date, **risk_off** otherwise —
  matching the breadth-regime detector's 50% line. If you want a finer split (a neutral middle
  band, or a VIX overlay), that's a structural change I'll make on your word. Built on this
  assumption: `baserates.py` (`assign_regimes`), and every base_rate_stat row carries `regime`.

- **[VETO?] Base-rate universe scope.** For P4 the nightly computes base rates over the **served +
  watchlist** symbols' history (the ~15-20 symbols the user actually sees cards for), not the full
  ~13k universe. This is fast, and honest by construction — small N is suppressed by the N-gate and
  capped to WEAK — but the samples are thin, so most patterns will show "insufficient history"
  until the universe of interest and the Parquet lake grow. Computing base rates over the full
  universe's historical replay (larger N) is a heavier nightly step I can enable if you want the
  broader market as the reference class. Logged in DECISIONS.md.

- **[FYI] Decay-note wording is my plain-English capture, not the RR Part 4 verbatim text.** The
  `pattern_meta` decay notes and evidence grades in `baserates.py` follow Appendix F's ledger
  summary (golden-cross weak / BLL 1992·STW 1999, 52w-high mixed / George–Hwang 2004, gap
  folklore, RSI weak, volume mixed / GKM 2001, breadth context-only). When the Research Report
  Part 4 text is to hand, the exact phrasing should be transcribed over my paraphrase.

- **[FYI] breadth-regime evidence grade.** Appendix F calls breadth "context-only", which isn't one
  of the four ledger grades (supported/mixed/weak/folklore). I graded it **weak** with a decay
  note saying it is market context, not a tradable edge. Tell me if you'd rather it render
  differently (e.g. a distinct "context" label).

## 2026-07-10

- **[RESOLVED 2026-07-11] LCP budget miss at phase-0.** You accepted it for P0 and asked me to
  "make it a real gate at P1." Done: the LCP ≤ 2.5s budget is now a HARD gate at the P1 exit —
  `scripts/lighthouse-check.mjs` already exits non-zero on an LCP miss, and P1 will not be tagged
  until LCP passes for real (P1 adds real content, so the measurement becomes meaningful and the
  actual LCP element can be optimised). Recorded in DECISIONS.md (2026-07-11).
  <details><summary>original [VETO?] context</summary>
  Every real budget passed at phase-0 (perf 90-95, a11y 100, CLS 0, JS 131KB, 12-17ms server);
  only LCP (2.8-3.4s, run-to-run variance) missed, as a synthetic cold-4G artifact on a
  contentless page — the app was already optimally built. You accepted this for P0.</details>

- **[CLOSED 2026-07-11] Optional cleanups — all resolved:**
  - **Supabase DB password rotation — DECLINED by Bishan (2026-07-11).** Keeping the current
    password. Closed; will not raise again.
  - **"My First Check" in healthchecks.io — DONE.** Bishan deleted it (2026-07-11). Closed.
  - **Connect the GitHub repo in Vercel — DONE.** Bishan connected it (2026-07-11); `git push`
    now auto-deploys. (I no longer deploy via the CLI.)
  - If you want me to run the healthchecks drill or Lighthouse locally in future, add
    HEALTHCHECKS_PING_URL + HEALTHCHECKS_API_KEY to the repo-root `.env` (Appendix D lists the
    API key as local too). For now I run those through GitHub Actions where the secrets live.
