# PATTERNS.md — recurring code & design patterns worth copying

Add an entry when you catch yourself copying something a SECOND time (plan §9.1). Reference
entries from code reviews. Write every entry in plain English — describe the pattern the way you
would explain it to a new teammate, and keep any code sample as the clear version, not the clever
one (CLAUDE.md, "Readability & documentation"). Format:

```
## <pattern-name>
Where it lives: <file(s)>
Shape: <the 3–6 line essence>
Use when: <trigger>
```

The plan pre-names four patterns expected to land here once they exist in code: the provider
adapter shape (P1), the SectionMasthead composition (P1), the server-action + zod + revalidate
write pattern (P1), and the useLightweightChart hook lifecycle (P1). Do not write them until the
first real implementation exists — this file records working code, not intentions.

## provider-adapter
Where it lives: pipeline/adapters/base.py (TokenBucket, load_fixture, Adapter) + one file per provider (alpaca.py).
Shape: subclass Adapter with super().__init__("<name>", client, limiter); call self.get(url, params=) which rate-limits + raises on non-2xx; parse JSON into frozen dataclasses only (no business logic). Tests replay REAL recorded fixtures via httpx.MockTransport + load_fixture; the job (not the adapter) catches per-source errors for sourceStatus.
Use when: adding any data-provider adapter. Follow the new-provider-adapter skill.
